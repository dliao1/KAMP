\title{KAMP univariate variance}
\usage{
kamp_variance(
  ppp_obj,
  rvals = c(0, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2),
  correction = "trans",
  mark1 = "immune"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ppp_obj}{A point pattern object of class "ppp" from the spatstat package.}

\item{rvals}{A vector of radii at which to calculate the KAMP variance.}

\item{correction}{Type of edge correction. Defaults to translational.}

\item{mark1}{The variable used to mark the points in the point pattern object. Default is "immune".}
}
\value{
A dataframe with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{r}{The radius at which K was calculated.}
\item{k}{The observed K value}
\item{theo_csr}{The theoretical K under CSR}
\item{kamp_csr}{The adjusted CSR representing the KAMP permuted expectation.}
\item{kamp}{The difference between observed K and KAMP CSR}
\item{var}{Variance of K under the permutation null distribution}
\item{pval}{P-value, calculated using the formula: pnorm(-z)}
}
}
\description{
Computes the KAMP (K-function Adjusted for Marked Permutations) variance
for a given spatial point pattern. Also returns the KAMP expectation,
z-statistic, and p-value.

Note: this a matrix-based implementation of the KAMP variance that
does not use the \code{spatstat} package. It is a wrapper around the
\code{kamp_variance_helper} function that calculates the KAMP variance at
one radius and maps it over a vector of radii.
